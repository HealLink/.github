# HealLink

With increasing mental health challenges worldwide, early detection and intervention are essential but often limited by access to professional resources. Many people experiencing symptoms of depression may not recognize them or seek help.

HealLink is a daily journaling app equipped with AI features to analyze mental conditions based on user stories. This project aims to develop an NLP-based tool to assess mental health indicators in user-submitted stories. This approach could provide an accessible way to identify those in need of support, promoting early intervention and potentially improving mental health outcomes. This app also has various features to help stabilize mental conditions such as streaming relaxation music and even getting the location of health facilities.
